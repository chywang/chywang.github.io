				<h2>Iterative Extraction of Chinese Hypernymy Relations from User Generated Categories [JAVA]</h2>
				<p>This software automatically extracts Chinese hypernymy relations from user generated entity-category pairs, based on a small training set of hypernymy relations. It iteratively updates the parameters of a piecewise linear projection model for hypernymy prediction via semi-supervised learning and pattern-based validation techniques. The projection model is trained using word embeddings of the iteratively enlarged training set.</p>

				<h2>Transductive Classification of Chinese Hypernymy vs. Non-hypernymy Relations Based on Word Embeddings [JAVA]</h2>
				<p>This software classifies Chinese word pairs into hypernymy vs. non-hypernymy relations based on transductive non-linear projection learning. Two datasets of Chinese word pairs (i.e., a training set and a testing set), together with all the embedding vectors of associated Chinese word pairs should be provided as inputs. The software automatically trains the model and makes predictions over the testing set.</p>

				<h2>CN-WikiCatReader: Fine-grained Relation Miner from Chinese Wikipedia Categories [JAVA]</h2>
				<p>This software extracts various types of fine-grained semantic relations from the Chinese Wikipedia category system, serving as a "deep reader" for Chinese short texts. It employs a rule-based extractor, a word embedding based projection learner, a collective inference step and hypernym expansion techniques to extract hypernymy relations from Chinese Wikipedia categories. We further design a fully unsupervised, data-driven algorithm to identify non-taxonomic relations (i.e., relations other than hypernymy) from these category names.</p>

				<h2>Exploratory Author Name Disambiguation On the Fly for DBLP [JAVA]</h2>
				<p>This software performs exploratory author name disambiguation for author pages in DBLP on-the-fly, which aims at linking ambiguous author names to real authors and discovering new authors without homepages at the same time. The algorithm takes all the publication records related to one author name in DBLP as input. It performs one of the three actions: i) linking the ambiguous author name in a publication record to an existing researcher of the same (or similar) name in DBLP, ii) creating a new author that are not in DBLP, or iii) predicting it as NIL, meaning no confident prediction can be made.</p>
